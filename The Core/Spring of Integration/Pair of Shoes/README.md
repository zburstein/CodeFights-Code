Yesterday you found some shoes in the back of your closet. Each shoe is described by two values:
type indicates if it's a left or a right shoe;
size is the size of the shoe.
Your task is to check whether it is possible to pair the shoes you found in such a way that each pair consists of a right and a left shoe of an equal size.
Example
For
shoes = [[0, 21], 
         [1, 23], 
         [1, 21], 
         [0, 23]]
the output should be
pairOfShoes(shoes) = true;
For
shoes = [[0, 21], 
         [1, 23], 
         [1, 21], 
         [1, 23]]
the output should be
pairOfShoes(shoes) = false.
Input/Output
[execution time limit] 4 seconds (rb)
[input] array.array.integer shoes
Array of shoes. Each shoe is given in the format [type, size], where type is either 0 or 1 for left and right respectively, and size is a positive integer.
Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ shoes.length ≤ 200,
1 ≤ shoes[i][1] ≤ 100.
[output] boolean
true if it is possible to pair the shoes, false otherwise.
